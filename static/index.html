	<p>I'm Yooseok Seo, a Computer Scientist-in-training currently attending at the University of California, San Diego.
	   I tackle complex problems in a field that's constantly evolving. I design, develop, and implement software.
	   When not developing bigger and better things, I spend most of my time playing with my three-year-old son.
	   I also put in miles training for marathons, try to travel to as many places as possible, learn about other people's stories, and obsess over typography.
	   I look forward to sharing my creativity and dedication to quality. Letâ€™s build something great together. </p>
